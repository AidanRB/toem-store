# toem-store
self-service store for [Theopenem](https://theopenem.com/). technically works.

as configured, any modules with the category `Self-Service` are available to all computers. i ran this on a NixOS machine using uWSGI, ymmv. it's incredibly basic but mostly gets the job done. it would need a lot of work before being used as a user-facing replacement for something like [Company Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/user-help/sign-in-to-the-company-portal) but the potential is there.
